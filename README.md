## Contents
- `nginx`: directory containing files related to the NGINX deployment of Section 3
  - `nginx-openstack.doml`: DOML model of the NGINX deployment targeting the OpenStack cloud service provider
  - `nginx-openstack-v2.doml`: DOML model corresponding to the previous one, but with the syntax from DOML v2.1
  - `nginx-openstack-v2.domlx`: XML representation of the DOML model v2.1
  - `ICG_output`: directory containing the IaC generated by the ICG from the nginx-openstack-v2 DOML model
- `wordpress`: directory containing files related to the Wordpress deployment of Section 7
  - `wordpress.doml`: DOML model of the Wordpress deployment, targeting both OpenStack and AWS
  - `ICG_output`: directory containing the IaC generated by the ICG from the Wordpress DOML model
  
## Additional resources

The Terraform and Cloudify implementations of the Wordpress case study analyzed in Section 7 can be found in the following repository:
https://github.com/leonardoreboucas/cloud-orchestrators-exam

In particular:
- [Terraform.](https://github.com/leonardoreboucas/cloud-orchestrators-exam/tree/master/terraform/aws)
  Note that the `*.tpl` files in the parent directory have been counted in the stats in Table 1, because they are required to run the deployment.
- [Cloudify.](https://github.com/leonardoreboucas/cloud-orchestrators-exam/tree/master/cloudify)
  Here we considered the file `aws.yaml` plus all files in directories `includes` and `wordpress`.
  
All line counts were computed with the following command, which excludes empty lines:
```sh
grep -rc '.' file1 file2 ...
```
